# Interacting Particle Dynamics Simulation

This project simulates the dynamics of interacting particle systems with common noise, with the Euler-Maruyama method. The simulation is performed using Python, and the results are visualized to understand the behavior of particles under different noise conditions and interactions.

## Overview

This notebook contains a simulation of particles over time using Brownian motion paths and mean-field interactions. The main objectives are:

- To simulate particle trajectories under stochastic dynamics.
- To visualize these trajectories and understand the effects of different parameters on particle motion.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib plotly
